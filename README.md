Project: Caesar Cipher
A Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, or Caesar’s code, is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It’s a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For instance, with a left shift of 3, `D` would become `A`, `E` would turn into `B`, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it for his private messages.
